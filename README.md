Scala framework that manages external services for tests (mock HTTP services, docker containers, databases, etc.)

Central concept of the framework is a [TestService](/src/main/scala/org/zalando/test/kit/service/TestService.scala):

```scala
trait TestService {
  def name: String
  def beforeSuite(): Unit = {}
  def beforeTest(): Unit = {}
  def afterTest(): Unit = {}
  def afterSuite(): Unit = {}
}
```

It represents some process (OS process, JVM thread) that is run concurrently and separately from the test [suite] and provides useful function for it (inspired by [JUnits Rules] (https://github.com/junit-team/junit/wiki/Rules#externalresource-rules)) Some examples are: database, mock rest service, docker container, etc. 

Test Service Kit manages lifecycle of `TestService`s by calling following lifecycle methods:
```scala
def beforeSuite(): Unit
def beforeTest(): Unit
def afterTest(): Unit
def afterSuite(): Unit
```
Specific test service could be bound to test suite lifecycle only by mixing [SuiteLifecycle](/src/main/scala/org/zalando/test/kit/service/SuiteLifecycle.scala) trait, in this case it must implement 
```scala
def start(): Unit // called before suite
def stop(): Unit // called after suite
```

or to test lifecycle only by mixing [TestLifecycle](/src/main/scala/org/zalando/test/kit/service/SuiteLifecycle.scala) trait, in which case it must implement 
```scala
def start(): Unit // called before each test
def stop(): Unit // called after each test
```

## Installation
Add the test-service-kit dependency to your SBT project
```scala
libraryDependencies += "org.zalando" %% "test-service-kit" % "6.0.0"
```

## Usage

1. Implement your own test service by extending [TestService](/src/main/scala/org/zalando/test/kit/service/TestService.scala)
or use one of the already implemented test services:

  * [MockServerTestService](/src/main/scala/org/zalando/test/kit/service/MockServerTestService.scala) to run [MockServer](http://www.mock-server.com) instance.
    For example usage see [MockServerTestServiceSpec](/src/test/scala/org/zalando/test/kit/service/MockServerTestServiceSpec.scala)
  * [DockerContainerTestService](/src/main/scala/org/zalando/test/kit/service/DockerContainerTestService.scala) to run any [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container.
    For example usage see [DockerContainerTestServiceSpec](/src/test/scala/org/zalando/test/kit/service/DockerContainerTestServiceSpec.scala)
  * [DatabaseTestService](/src/main/scala/org/zalando/test/kit/service/DatabaseTestService.scala) to run embedded PostgreSQL server.
    For example usage see [DatabaseTestServiceSpec](/src/test/scala/org/zalando/test/kit/service/DatabaseTestServiceDockerContainerTestServiceSpec.scala)
  * [JvmTestService](/src/main/scala/org/zalando/test/kit/service/JvmTestService.scala) to run JVM process.
    For example usage see [JvmTestServiceSpec](/src/test/scala/org/zalando/test/kit/service/JvmTestServiceSpec.scala)

2. Mixin trait to your spec
  * For [ScalaTest](http://scalatest.org/): [ScalatestServiceKit](/src/main/scala/org/zalando/test/kit/ScalatestServiceKit.scala)
  * For [Specs2](https://etorreborre.github.io/specs2/): [Specs2ServiceKit](/src/main/scala/org/zalando/test/kit/Specs2ServiceKit.scala)

3. Define services used by your spec:
  ```scala
  case MyCoolSpec extends FlatSpec with ScalatestServiceKit {
    val oauthApi = new MockServerTestService("Mocked REST API", port = 8080) with SuiteLifecycle
    val database = new DatabaseTestService("Embedded Postgres", port = 5432) with SuiteLifecycle
    val container = new DockerContainerTestService(config.get[DockerContainerConfig]("docker-container")) with TestLifecycle
    val app = new JvmTestService("My JVM App", mainClass = "org.zalando.test.kit.service.TestApplication") with SuiteLifecycle
  }
  ```
  
4. Define order in which test services are started/stopped:
  ```scala
  case MyCoolSpec extends FlatSpec with ScalatestServiceKit {
    ...
    override def testServices = (oauthApi || database) >> container
  }
  ```

  Legend:
  * `a || b` (alias `a inParallelWith b`) means test services `a` and `b` are started/stopped concurrently.
  * `a >> b` (alias `a andThen b`) means test services are started one after another (`a` then `b`) and stopped in reverse order (`b` then `a`).
  * For detailed example of composition see: [TestServiceCompositionSpec](/src/test/scala/org/zalando/test/kit/TestServiceCompositionSpec.scala)
